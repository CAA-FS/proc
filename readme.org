* proc

A clojure-based post processor for the MARATHON 4.x / 3.x series simulations.
Computes detailed temporal datasets (histories) from canonical simulation output.
Provides a point of departure for additional tooling/scripting to produce 
boutique data and interactive analysis. 

* Usage

Check example.cljs for the "working" api.  Note: this is alpha 
quality research software, and is subject to change on a whim.

One or more namespaces, particularly utilities, may be migrated 
to other libraries (like SPOrK) or forked off if they have enough 
density.  Additionally, entire namespaces "may" be jettisoned in the 
future. 

* Developer notes 

"proc" began life as a simple set of scripts to offload tedious 
data processing for discrete event simulation output.  

It gained utility and traction, serving as a hub for additional 
"non-simulation" specific features [stuff we didn't want to jam into 
the simulation infrastructure]. 

Consequently, "proc" is due for serious revision and rewriting.  In particular, 
some of the charting and analysis scripts are open for serious revision/elimination. 

Still, proc contains examples of collecting, joining, visualizing, and producing 
temporal datasets from variable-step discrete samples.  

This is an open source mirror of the production version of proc, and is likely to 
be several revisions "behind."  For testing, integration, and verification purposes, 
it serves as useful proxy for MARATHON 4.x .
